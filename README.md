I have only managed to create a rough idea of authentication with SQL stuff. I have to include DOB, and also have to actually configure PostgreSQL in the code. I dont have username or password yet. The slice I created for movies will remain empty for a while. I hope this authentication process will be completed by tomorrow. I will add the movies stuff atleast by day after tomorrow eveming, and any and all modifications by Sunday EOD.

Best of luck me, I guess.
